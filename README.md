# Image Processing for Quantification of Nanowire Alignment on Surfaces
Nanowire quantification tool built using the Rappture Toolkit.  This program uses image processing tools to quantifiy nanowire alignment in SEM images of nanowires.  The tool does its quantification using a mathematical oritentation order parameter.
